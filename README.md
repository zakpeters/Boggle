# CS3500 Boggle

Final Project for Software Practices (CS3500). Coded by me and my partner Tyler Gardner.

Designed to match the API specifications described in the "Boggle API.html" file.

This repository contains:

Boggle Client: A GUI Application that communicates with a server and allows 2 players to play a game of Boggle.

Boggle Server: Implementation of the Boggle service. 

Unit tests for both projects
